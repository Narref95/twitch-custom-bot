# Twitch Customizable BOT

This bot was created just to have a countdown in chat to join customs in Fall Guys :)
But I added some custom counters and commands and my friends are asking to get the bot also, so I uploaded it here just for share it.

## Commands

This bot allows creating the following commands:
* Return a custom message when a command is sent
* Start a countdown in chat
* Custom counters, have the count of the times you win a game... or you loose them.
* The messages allows passing parameters to them (example: !follow CHANNEL) and the message sent by the bot can use them
* Restrict commands by twitch role, maybe you dont want EVERYONE to run commands.
    * Roles supported: EVERYONE, MOD, STREAMER (owner of the channel)

## Installation
Twitch Customizable BOT requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run. Tested with v16.13.2
